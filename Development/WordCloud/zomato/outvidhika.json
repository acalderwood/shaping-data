"Cappannaris dropped in for a special event organised by the building concierge. If you are looking for old fashioned floats they are the people. I had an orange soda float ( vanilla ice cream), which was very good. Great Service!. I don't live in Chicago, but needed to send a cold treat to my clients on a hot day (when their A/C unit at the office went out)! I found Capannari's online and called them up. They were amazing, made my clients so happy with a mid-day ice cream break with their \"Party-in-Box\". If I am ever in Chicago, i will definitely be paying them a visit in person, and if i need to have happiness delivered again, I will call them! Pint sale is next week. Time to stock up! Absolutely fantastic!!! This is a secret neighborhood treasure that is a must try. The hungry hound from abc 7 news has been their and rated it excellent. Don't pass this one up "
